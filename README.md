## Day 5 Project - SURF & PADDLE CO.

LIVE website: [mlyck-day05.surge.sh](https://mlyck-day05.surge.sh)

We were tasked to recreate a pixel perfect website from an image

We were given 2 options, an easy one called "SURF & PADDLE CO.", and a harder 'Adventure Mode' called "[MOBBER](https://github.com/MarkLyck/TIY-day03)" I had some extra time on my hand, so I did both projects.

Here's the image we were tasked to recreate:
![S&P Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/assets/master/assignments/1.4-pixel-perfect/surf-and-paddle.png "Website  reference")

And here is a screenshot from my website:
![My website](https://github.com/MarkLyck/TIY-day05/blob/master/images/S_and_P_Screenshot.png?raw=true "My version")

We didn't get the image files for this project, so I found visually similar images for my version.

At first I did have the button and image highlighed like in the design. But later I decided to make those the hover effects instead.

For the Epic mode we were also tasked to make the website responsive which I did as well:
