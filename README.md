## Day 5 Project - SURF & PADDLE CO.

We were tasked to recreate a pixel perfect website from an image

We were given 2 options, an easy one called "SURF & PADDLE CO.", and a harder 'Adventure Mode' called "[MOBBER](https://github.com/MarkLyck/TIY-day03)" I had some extra time on my hand, so I did both projects.

Here's the image we were tasked to recreate:
